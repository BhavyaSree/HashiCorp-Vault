title: TOTP Secrets Engine
---

TOTP stands for Time-based one-time passwords.  

These are temporary passcodes and they typically expires after 30,60,120 and 240 seconds.  
Eg: Google Authenticator  

In vault, the TOTP secrets engine can act as both a generator (like Google Authenticator) and a provider (like the google.com sign in service).  

`Step 1:`  
Generate Data for Bar code:  
`vault write --field=barcode totp/keys/bhavya generate=true issuer=vault account_name=bhavya@internal`   
store the output in the file named decode.  

`Step 2:`  
Decode the data and store it to an image file.  
`cat decode | base64 -d > totp.jpg`   

`Step 3:`  
Scan code with google authenticator and verify  
- Scan QR code with google authenticator.  -- bhavya@internal will be added.
- Verify the code with vault   
`vault read totp/code/bhavya`
