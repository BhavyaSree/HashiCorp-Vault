title: Vault for Production Environment
---

Under devlopment mode, all data was stored in-memory.  

For production, we need a better storage class to store the data.  

There are multiple storage class that can be used, some of these includes:

* Filesystem
* S3
* Consul
* Databases (MySQL, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL).  

*Step 1: Create a configuration file*   
Outside the development mode, vault servers are configured using a specific configuration file.   
The format of the configuration file is HCL or JSON   

```
storage "file" {
  path = "/root/vault-data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}
```

*Step 2: Start Vault server from configuration file*  
Start the vault server by specifying the configuration file created in the step1.   
`vault server -config demo.hcl`  

*Step 3: Initalize the vault*   
This only happens once when the server is started against a new backend that has never been used with the vault before.  

During initialization, the encryption keys are generated, unseal keys are created, and the initial root token is setup.  
`vault operator init`   

*Step4: Unseal the vault*  
Every initialized vault server starts in the sealed state. From the configuration, vault can access the physical storage, but it can't read any of it because it does not know how to decrypt it.  

The process of teaching vault how to decrypt the data is known as unsealing the vault.   
`vault operator unseal`   

We need to unseal 3 unseal keys.  
sealed state: false  

To get the token accessors   
`vault list auth/token/accessors`   

Once we unseal the keys, in root we can see a vault-data folder, where we can find core, logical and sys directories.  

For production environments, we need to make sure that tls is nor disabled.  

## Points

* Initilaization outputs two incredibly important pieces of information: the unseal keys and the initial root token.  

* This is the only time ever that all of this data is known by vault, and also the only time that the unseal keys should ever be so close together.  

Generally, unseal keys will be distributed between the team members.  

## Vault GUI in production

Under demo.hcl  
```
storage "file" {
  path = "/root/vault-data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}

ui = "true"
```

We can unseal the keys through GUI too..
