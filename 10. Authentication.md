title: Authentication
---

Authentication is the process of recognizing a user's identity.  

Authentication can be based on various approaches like username/password, tokens and others.  

There are multiple ways which we can authenticate in vault.  

Before a client can interact with vault, it must authenticate against an auth method.  

**In GUI:**
Access --> Auth methods --> Enable new method --> username and password --> next --> update the path (if needed) --> enable.  

Now in Auth methods, we will have two methods i.e., token and userpass.  
Click on userpass --> Create user --> create new user and save.  

In CLI to work with user  
`vault login -method=userpass username=admin password=admin`

We can use the username and passowrd can be used to login the vault. But, with this the user will have very basic permissions.  

Various Authentication methods available in vault are  

* Token
* Username
* LDAP
* Okta
* JWT
* OIDC
* RADIUS
* GitHUb
