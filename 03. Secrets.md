title: Storing Secrets in vault
---

One of the core features of vault is to read and write secrets securely.  

Secret engines are components which store, generate, or encrypt data.  

We can store secret based on a specific search engine and each offers certain features.

## To add kv secret through GUI

![kv-Secret](./Images/kv-secret.png)

We can create multiple versions for this by clicking on create new version.  

We can switch to any version and also can view the history of the versions. 

We have two options to delete the versions.  

* Delete version - this can be fetched later
* Permanently destroy version - this cannot be fetched

Once we delete the version, we will have the option to undelete version to restore the specific version.  

We can also delete the secret. When we delete the secret, all the versions of the secret are permanently deleted.  

## To add kv secret through CLI

To get all the options of KV    
`vault kv -h`   

```
Create or update the key named "foo" in the "secret" mount with the value
  "bar=baz":

      $ vault kv put secret/foo bar=baz

  Read this value back:

      $ vault kv get secret/foo

  Get metadata for the key:

      $ vault kv metadata get secret/foo

  Get a specific version of the key:

      $ vault kv get -version=1 secret/foo

  Please see the individual subcommand help for detailed usage information.
