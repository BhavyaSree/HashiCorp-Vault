title: Vault Policy rules - Transit Engine
---

For the vault clients to be able to perform the encrypt and decrypt operations, there are two important policy rules that need to be added.  

```
# to access the tranist secret keys and to encrpt and decrypt the data.
path "transit/encrypt/<key-name>"
{
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

path "transit/decrypt/<key-name>"
{
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

# Specifically related to GUI, we need to add the capabilities of read and list as below.
# to list the keys available
path "transit/key" 
{
  capabilities = ["list"]
}

# to read the keys
path "transit/key/<key-name>" 
{
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```
