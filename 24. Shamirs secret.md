title: Shamirs Secret
---

The storage backend in vault is considered to be untrusted. The data stored in the storage backend is within the encrypted state.  

When the vault is initialized, it generates an encryption key which is used to protect all the data. That key is protected by a master key.  

Vault uses a technique known as shamir's secret sharing alogorithm to split the master key into 5 shares, any 3 of which are required to reconstruct the master key.  

The number of shares and the minimum threshold required can both be specified.  

Shamir's technique  can be disbaled and the master key used directly for unsealing.  

Once the vault retrives the encryption key, it is able to decrypt the data in the storage backend, and enters the unsealed state.
