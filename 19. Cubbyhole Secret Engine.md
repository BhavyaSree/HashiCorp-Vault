title: Cubbyhole Secret Engine
---

The cubbyhole secret engine provides our own private secret storage space where no one else can read (including root).  

It is not possible to reach into another token's cubbyhole even as the root user.  

The cubbyhole secret engine is enabled by default. It cannot be disabled, moved, or enabled multiple times. 

* In cubbyhole, paths are scoped per token
* No tokens can access another token's cubbyhole
* When the token expires, its cubbyhole is destroyed.
