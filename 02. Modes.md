There are two modes that we can consider in vault

* Dev mode
* prod mode

The Dev Server mode in vault is useful for local development, testing and exploration.  
The development mode is not very secure and when we start the vault in development mode, eveything is stored in-memory (will loose data on every restart).   

To start vault as a server in 'DEV' mode.   
`vault server -dev`. 

Below is the sample of output.  
```
Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:8200
                     Cgo: disabled
         Cluster Address: https://127.0.0.1:8201
              Go Version: go1.16.7
              Listener 1: tcp (addr: "127.0.0.1:8200", cluster address: "127.0.0.1:8201", max_request_duration: "1m30s", max_request_size: "33554432", tls: "disabled")
               Log Level: info
                   Mlock: supported: false, enabled: false
           Recovery Mode: false
                 Storage: inmem
                 Version: Vault v1.8.2
             Version Sha: aca76f63357041a43b49f3e8c11d67358496959f


You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: rjehbUMCkE8lF/934rH8SNA0OqV2K9D6wDDZQGfY16U=
Root Token: s.6DJv9GCahZRPZh3kI3OLEnCM
```

This runs as http, so we need to add an enviornmental variable.  
`export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'` (this will be provided in the output while starting server).

Access `http://127.0.0.1:8200` in webbrowser for vault UI.
The root token for th vault UI will be provided in output while starting the dev server.

To check the status of vault, open one more terminal tab and give `vault status`  

```
> vault status                                                   
Key             Value
