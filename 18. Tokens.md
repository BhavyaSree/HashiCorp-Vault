title: Tokens
---

Tokens are the core method for authentication within vault.  

With `vault server -dev`, we have been using the root token. This is the first method of authentication for vault.   
It is also the only method that cannot be disabled.  

Within vault, tokens map to the specific information.

The most important information mapped to a token is a set of one or more attached policies.  

Token 1 ---> Policies (default, custom-policy)   

The user for which the token1 is generated, even if we attach one more policy to that user. That policy will not be associated with the token.  

The token will have only the policies that were attached to the user during the token generation.  
If we attach a policy to the user for which token is already generated. The token won't be having the new policy attached.  

To deal this, we can regenerate the token i.e., run vault login again. 

Contradict to this, if we just add some rules to the policy attached to the token, then the new rules will come into effect to the token without regeneration. This is because the policy has been already attached at the time of token generation.  

## Lookup token information

To explore the details of a token   
`vault token lookup` - This will show information about current token   
`vault token lookup <token>` - This shows information of specific token


## Token Helper

The vault CLI uses a "token helper" to cache the token after authentication.  

The default token helper stores the token in `~/.vault_token`.   
We can delete this file, whenever we want to logout of the vault.  


## Tokens Time-to-live

Time-To-Live (TTL) limits the lifetime of the data.  

Every non-root token has time-to-live (TTL) associated with it.  

After the TTL is up, the token will no longer function, and its associated leases are revoked.  

To create token with the user defined TTL   
`vault token create --ttl=600`   

To renew a token   
`vault token renew --increment=30m <token>`   

When we do vault token create, the default TTL is `768h`.  
We will get this default values from `sys/auth/token/tune` -- `vault read sys/auth/token/tune`

When we have root token. To login `vault login <token>`   

## Lifecycle of Service Tokens  

When a token holder creates a new tokens, these tokens will be created as the children of the original token.  

In this case, if the parent is revoked or expires, so do all its children regardless of their own TTLs.  

## Token Accessor

When tokens are created, a token accessor is also created and returned.  

This accessor is a value that acts as a reference to a token and can only be used to perform limited actions:  

* Look up token's properties (not including the actual token ID) - `vault token lookup --accessor <accessorId>`
* Look up on the token's capabilities on the path
* Renew the token 
* Revoke the token

For renew or revoke the toke, we can specify the token_accessor instead of tokenId (secure way).  

To see the accessors that are available   
`vault list auth/token/accessors`  

To explore the token we can also use accessor   
`vault token lookup --accessor <accessorId>` (Here, we won't get token Id).  

Therefore, accessor can be used instead of using token directly.

From the token accessor, we cannot generate token.. 

## Orphaned Tokens

Orphan token are not children of their parent; therefore, orphan tokens do not expire when their parent does.  

Orphan tokens are the root of their own token tree.  

Orphan tokens still expire when their own max TTL is reached.  

We can find whether a token is orphan or not by doing lookup on the token  
`vault token lookup <token>` -- In the ouput, we can see the orphan status of the token.  

To create child token
`vault token create`   

To create orphan token   
`vault token create -orphan`   
This specific CLI command requires root token or sudo capability on the auth/token/create path.
